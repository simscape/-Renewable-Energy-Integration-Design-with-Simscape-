# **Renewable Energy Integration Design with Simscape**
This repository provides design solutions for the operation of power systems with high penetration of renewable energy sources. The developed models comply with current IEEE/IEC and national grid standards.

## Performance Evaluation of Grid Forming Battery Energy Storage Systems in Solar PV Plants
This project evaluates the capabilities of a grid-forming (GFM) battery energy storage system (BESS) in maintaining a stable power system with high penetration of solar photovoltaic (PV). 
Use this model to assess the dynamic performance of the BESS connected to the PV plant during normal operation and contingencies, such as a large drop in PV power, significant load change, grid outage, and faults. Simulate the model to verify whether the designed PV plant and BESS unit, along with their associated controllers, conform the performance requirements the current IEEE 2800 standards. 

## Setup

- Clone the repository and add to MATLAB path, then click the 'RenewableEnergyIntegrationwithSimscape.prj' file to get started. 
- In the toolstrip, use the project shortcut buttons to load the model.
- This project requires MATLAB&reg; R2022b or later.
