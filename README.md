# **Renewable Energy Integration Design with Simscape&trade;**
The repository provides design solutions that aid the operation of power systems with high penetration of renewable energy sources. The developed models comply with current IEEE/IEC and national grid standards.

## Performance Evaluation of Grid Forming Battery Energy Storage Systems in Solar PV Plants
This project evaluates the capabilities of a grid-forming (GFM) battery energy storage system (BESS) in maintaining a stable power system with high penetration of solar photovoltaic (PV). 
Use this model to assess the dynamic performance of the BESS connected to PV plant during normal operation and contingencies, such as a large drop in PV power, significant load change, grid outage, and faults. Simulate the model to verify whether the designed PV plant and BESS unit, along with their associated controllers, conform the performance requirements the current IEEE 2800 standards recommend. 

## Getting Started

- Clone the repository and add to Matlab path, then click the 'RenewableEnergyIntegrationwithSimscape.prj' file to get started. You can use the
  project shortcut buttons in the toolstrip to load the model.
- Requires MATLAB&reg; R2022b or later.
